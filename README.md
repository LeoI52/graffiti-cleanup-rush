# Graffiti Cleanup Rush

## About me

Hey ! I'm LÃ©o Imbert. I created this game solo for a game jam, mainly because itâ€™s tough to find people who work with Pyxel. Everything in the game was made during the jam, except for the graffiti assets, which are from Craftpix. You can check them out here : https://free-game-assets.itch.io/free-graffiti-constructor-pixel-art.

## About the game

This game was made in 3 days for the Mini Jame Gam #43. The theme was 'Overflow' and the special object was 'Brush'. These inspired me to create a game centered around paint !
- Theme interpretation : The wall gets overflowed with graffitis, and you need to stop it.
- Special object : Your mouse cursor is the brush.
I built the game using Pyxel, a Python-based retro game engine. So technically, I didnâ€™t use a traditional game engine, which is why the game might feel simple. If you're curious, check out Pyxel's documentation here: https://github.com/kitao/pyxel.

## How to play

Like I said you need to remove the graffitis that are appearing on the wall. You do so by applying paint on those ones, on your left you have your paint-meter. You can fill it up by hovering over the bucket on the right side, be careful the hitbox is pretty small ðŸ˜‰. Sometimes, stars will fall from the top of the screen. Click them before they disappear to get a random bonus :
- Fully refill your paint-meter.
- Clear all graffiti.
- Gain +50 points.
If there are more than 10 graffitis on the wall at once, you lose. So paint fast and aim for the highest score possible !
